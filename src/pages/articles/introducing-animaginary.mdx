Ever since my discovery of efficient software and tools such as Alfred and Vim,
I have sought to develop the most BLAZINGLY FAST Mac workflow possible.

In this article, I will share that workflow—its constituent parts and my individual configuration of tools.

## Neovim

My first (and favorite) tool that I use daily is Neovim. Neovim is a hyperextensible
Vim-based text editor.

For those who don't know what Vim is, it's essentially a text editor that can be controlled entirely with the keyboard. Neovim is a vastly superior fork of Vim, extensible in Lua and featuring a vast selection of plugins. You can read more about it [here](https://opensource.com/resources/what-vim).

When I first started using Neovim, I developed and maintained my own configuration. However, this was frustrating and resulted in countless hours of wasted debugging. 

To remedy this complaint with an otherwise fantastic tool, I've switched to [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim), a Neovim configuration maintained by others. AstroNvim deals with all of the annoying parts of Neovim, provides sensible defaults, and still allows for the hyperextensibility key to Neovim's identity. My configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/charliesabino).

I use and love many plugins; however, some of my favorites are Telescope, Leap, Comment, Packer, Whick-Key, Mason, and ToggleTerm.

Learning Vim is a grind, but having done it, I can say with certainty that it is well worth it—I can't imagine going back to using a mouse.  Additionally, learning the ways of Vim allows for greater efficiency in the parts of a workflow outside of programming, evidenced by the later parts of this article.

## Raycast

As a long-time Alfred user and devotee, I can say with confidence that Raycast is superior in almost every way.

For those of you who are unaware, Alfred and Raycast are spotlight extension tools. They allow you to perform many tasks—unit conversions, quitting and opening apps, controlling Spotify, viewing clipboard history, defining words, etc.—by simply activating spotlight (command + space). 

I recently switched from Alfred to Raycast due to the latter's superior plugin library; however, both are great choices. They are much easier tools to pick up than Vim and arguably facilitate greater improvements in efficiency as well.

Some of my favorite Raycast plugins include [Kill Process](https://www.raycast.com/rolandleth/kill-process), [Spotify Player](https://www.raycast.com/mattisssa/spotify-player), [Bitwarden](https://www.raycast.com/pomdtr/bitwarden), [YouTube Search](https://www.raycast.com/pomdtr/bitwarden), and [DevDocs](https://www.raycast.com/pomdtr/devdocs). 

## Yabai + SKHD

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ytjdWXIBB1WifvJidY/giphy.gif" width="100%" height="0" />

Yabai and SKHD are two separate tools that, when combined, provide by far the best windows management on Mac. I have configured the two such that I can resize, maximize/minimize, and switch between windows and desktops using Vim mappings. 

Here is my Yabai config:
```python
# global settings
yabai -m config mouse_follows_focus          off
yabai -m config focus_follows_mouse          off
yabai -m config window_origin_display        default
yabai -m config window_placement             second_child
yabai -m config window_topmost               off
yabai -m config window_shadow                on
yabai -m config window_opacity               off
yabai -m config window_opacity_duration      0.0
yabai -m config active_window_opacity        1.0
yabai -m config normal_window_opacity        0.90
yabai -m config window_border                off
yabai -m config window_border_width          6
yabai -m config active_window_border_color   0xff775759
yabai -m config normal_window_border_color   0xff555555
yabai -m config insert_feedback_color        0xffd75f5f
yabai -m config split_ratio                  0.50
yabai -m config auto_balance                 off
yabai -m config mouse_modifier               fn
yabai -m config mouse_action1                move
yabai -m config mouse_action2                resize
yabai -m config mouse_drop_action            swap

# general space settings
yabai -m config layout                       bsp
yabai -m config top_padding                  15
yabai -m config bottom_padding               15
yabai -m config left_padding                 15
yabai -m config right_padding                15
yabai -m config window_gap                   15

# apps to not manage (ignore)
yabai -m rule --add app="^System Preferences$" manage=off
yabai -m rule --add app="^Archive Utility$" manage=off
yabai -m rule --add app="^Wally$" manage=off
yabai -m rule --add app="^Pika$" manage=off
yabai -m rule --add app="^balenaEtcher$" manage=off
yabai -m rule --add app="^Creative Cloud$" manage=off
yabai -m rule --add app="^Logi Options$" manage=off

echo "yabai configuration loaded..">)
```

And here is my SKHD Config:
```python
# focus window
alt - h : yabai -m window --focus west
alt - j : yabai -m window --focus south
alt - k : yabai -m window --focus north
alt - l : yabai -m window --focus east

# swap managed window
shift + alt - h : yabai -m window --swap west
shift + alt - j : yabai -m window --swap south
shift + alt - k : yabai -m window --swap north

# move managed window
shift + alt + ctrl - h : yabai -m window --warp west
shift + alt + ctrl - j : yabai -m window --warp south
shift + alt + ctrl - k : yabai -m window --warp north
shift + alt + ctrl - l : yabai -m window --warp east

# rotate tree
alt - r : yabai -m space --rotate 90

# toggle window fullscreen zoom

shift + alt - 6 : yabai -m window --space 6; yabai -m space --focus 6
shift + alt - 7 : yabai -m window --space 7; yabai -m space --focus 7
shift + alt - 8 : yabai -m window --space 8; yabai -m space --focus 8
shift + alt - 9 : yabai -m window --space 9; yabai -m space --focus 9

# create desktop, move window and follow focus - uses jq for parsing json (brew install jq)
shift + alt - n : yabai -m space --create && \
                   index="$(yabai -m query --spaces --display | jq 'map(select(."native-fullscreen" == 0))[-1].index')" && \
                   yabai -m window --space "${index}" && \
                   yabai -m space --focus "${index}"

# fast focus desktop
alt - 0 : yabai -m space --focus recent

# send window to monitor and follow focus
shift + alt - n : yabai -m window --display next; yabai -m display --focus next
shift + alt - p : yabai -m window --display previous; yabai -m display --focus previous

# increase window size
shift + alt - w : yabai -m window --resize top:0:-20
shift + alt - d : yabai -m window --resize left:-20:0

# decrease window size
shift + alt - s : yabai -m window --resize bottom:0:-20
shift + alt - a : yabai -m window --resize top:0:20

# switch between desktops
alt - 1 : yabai -m space --focus 1
alt - 2 : yabai -m space --focus 2
alt - 3 : yabai -m space --focus 3
alt - 4 : yabai -m space --focus 4
alt - 5 : yabai -m space --focus 5
alt - 6 : yabai -m space --focus 6
alt - 7 : yabai -m space --focus 7
alt - 8 : yabai -m space --focus 8
alt - 9 : yabai -m space --focus 9

```

## Better Touch Tool

I don't use Better Touch Tool for much, but it is convenient for navigating to an application whose desktop number I'm unaware of or opening an instance of an app if it isn't already.

For example, I use option + b to navigate to my browser, option + i to navigate to my terminal, and option + s to navigate to my email.

## Superhuman

Although ridiculously expensive, Superhuman is an email client that can be controlled entirely with the keyboard using Vim-like mappings. Not sure if that justifies the price tag, but they do offer a student discount.

## Chrome Extensions

Vimium is a Chrome extension that, once again, as the name implies, allows for browser navigation solely through the keyboard using Vim mappings. It has improved my browser traversal efficiency by several factors, and I can't imagine living without it.

Video Speed Controller is a Chrome Extension that allows you to speed videos found anywhere on the internet up to the speed of your choosing. I tend to watch videos at 2x speed, but sometimes push them up to 3.5x if I'm bored or find the content easy to grasp. The inability to speed up videos without distorting audio in WebKit-based browsers is the sole thing that keeps me using Chromium-based ones.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed reading! This article was intended to serve as a top-level view into my productivity workflow and tools—I hope you found it helpful. If you'd like a more detailed explanation about how I use them, be sure to check back in the future.
